4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
4.1 Choose a number between 1 and 10 and assign it to the variable secret. Then, select another number between 1 and 10 and assign it to the variable guess. Next, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to print the string 'too low' if guess is less than secret, 'too high' if greater than secret, and 'just right' if equal to secret.
>>> 1 = secret
>>> 3 = guess
>>> too low = <
<<< too high = >
<<< just right = =
if too low 
   print("variable x is less than variable y")
if too high
   print("variable x is greater than variable y")
if just right 
   print("variable x and y are the same")

4.2 Assign True or False to the variables small and green. Write some if/else statements to print which of these matches those choices: cherry, pea, watermelon, pumpkin.
if variable small and green
  print("its a pea")
if variable not small and green
  print("its a watermelon")
if variable small and not green
  print("its a cherry")
if variable not small and not green
  print("its a pumpkin")
  
  6.1 Use a for loop to print the values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0].
  numbers = ["3", "2", "1", "0"]
for x in numbers:
  print(x)
  
  
  6.2 Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me, and the value 1 to the variable number. Write a while loop that compares number with guess_me. Print 'too low' if number is less than guess me. If number equals guess_me, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. If number is greater than guess_me, print 'oops' and then exit the loop. Increment number at the end of the loop.

>>> 7 = guess_me
>>> 1 = 2
number = x
if number less than guess_me 
  print("too low")
if number equals guess_me
  print("found it!")
if number greater than guess_me
  print("oops")
    exit;

  
  6.3 Assign the value 5 to the variable guess_me. Use a for loop to iterate a variable called number over range(10). If number is less than guess_me, print 'too low'. If it equals guess_me, print found it! and then break out of the for loop. If number is greater than guess_me, print 'oops' and then exit the loop.
  >>> 5 = guess_me
  >>> number = over range(10)
  if number is less than guess_me
     print("too low")
  if number is equal to guess_me
     print("found it!")
  if number is greater than guess_me
     print("oops")
       exit;
